#How to reset your password and regain access to your account

If you're having trouble accessing your account, the first thing you should do is try resetting your password. This can be done by clicking on the "Forgot password" button on the login screen. Once you do that, you'll be prompted to enter your registered email address.

After you enter your email address, you'll receive a message to your email account with instructions on how to complete a password reset. Note that this will mean creating a new password for your account.

It's important to note that the password reset process can take a few minutes. If you still cannot access your account after resetting your password, please email customer support at support@fybe.com from your registered email address for further help in getting access to your account.
